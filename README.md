# Hike App

This is an app created as a part of SwiftUI + SwiftData Masterclass - iOS App Development Swift course projects. In this app, I learned many new things even though I have already touched SwiftUI before. Things I learned in this course:
- Custom button styles
- Importance of using static color names
- Creating custom objects with animations
- Using LabeledContent

Thank you so much for Robert Petras for this project and teachings!
